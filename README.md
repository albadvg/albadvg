### Hello! 👋 😊

✋ I'm Alba, a beginner graphic designer and front end developer working on a professional path that keeps me close to the visual language. 
☺️ I'm happy when I run into original and simple images that convey their message in a beautiful way.
💙 I've studied arts at uni.
💻 I make static pages with HTML, CSS (Sass) and Javascript.
✏️ I'm confortable using vector and image editing software.
👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything involving graphic and web design.
📫  You can reach me at azulentagrafica@gmail.com

👂🌿🐄 Also...I always feel curious about animals and plants.
